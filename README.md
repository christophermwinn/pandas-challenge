# pandas-challenge

The PyCitySchools_Winn.ipynb file in the PyCitySchools folder contains my submission for the PyCitySchools pandas-challenge.

The Analysis Summary and Conclusions are contained in a markdown cell at the beginning of the file.  The rest of the file is the code necessary to perform the district summary, school summary, and additional analysis.  This assignment drew on all the Pandas classes, as well as additional outside resources.
